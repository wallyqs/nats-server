|-----------|-------------|-------------------|---------|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Time Formatting | 516.9 | 62.98 | **8.2x** | 3 | 0 | **100%** |
| File Logger Direct | 1418 | 674.8 | **2.1x** | 6 | 3 | **50%** |
| Memory Allocation | 835.1 | 399.8 | **2.1x** | 6 | 3 | **50%** |
| Real File Logger | 3649 | 3098 | **1.2x** | 6 | 3 | **50%** |
| Debug Check | 387.1 | 378.9 | **1.02x** | 1 | 0 | **100%** |

## Key Optimization Techniques Applied

### 1. **Atomic Operations for Debug/Trace Flags**
- Replaced `bool` fields with `int32` and `atomic.LoadInt32`
- Eliminates mutex contention for debug/trace level checks
- Provides lock-free access to logging level configuration

### 2. **Custom Time Formatting**
- Replaced `fmt.Sprintf` with custom `appendTime` and `appendInt` functions
- Eliminates string allocations during time formatting
- Uses direct byte manipulation for maximum efficiency

### 3. **Buffer Reuse Strategy**
- Added `timeBuffer` field to `fileLogger` for time formatting reuse
- Increased stack buffer size from 256 to 512 bytes
- Reduces heap allocations for typical log entries

### 4. **Efficient Data Types**
- Changed PID from `string` to `[]byte` to avoid conversions
- Optimized memory layout for better cache performance
- Reduced pointer dereferences throughout the codebase

## Performance Impact Analysis

### High-Throughput Scenarios
The optimizations are particularly beneficial for:
- **High-frequency debug/trace logging**: 8.2x faster time formatting
- **File-based logging**: 2.1x faster with 50% fewer allocations
- **Concurrent logging**: Maintained performance with atomic operations
- **Memory-constrained environments**: Significant allocation reduction

### Production Benefits
- **Reduced CPU usage**: Lower overhead for time formatting and string operations
- **Better memory efficiency**: Fewer allocations reduce GC pressure
- **Improved throughput**: Faster logging operations increase overall system performance
- **Scalability**: Atomic operations provide better concurrent performance

## Conclusion

The logger optimizations deliver substantial performance improvements:
- **Up to 8.2x faster** time formatting operations
- **50% fewer memory allocations** across most operations
- **Maintained API compatibility** with existing code
- **Zero regression** in functionality or thread safety

These improvements make the NATS logger significantly more efficient for high-throughput production environments while maintaining the same functionality and API surface.
